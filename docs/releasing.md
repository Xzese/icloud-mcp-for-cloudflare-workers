# Publishing the public repository

Develop and publish from the repository root. No separate maintained source export is needed.
The tracked configuration contains only public templates; operator-specific configuration and
state stay in ignored files. Run the README's build and test checks and:

```bash
npm run public-config:check
gitleaks git . --log-opts=--all --redact
```

The configuration check rejects private identifiers, common credential patterns and tracked
private/generated files. Review scanner findings and Git history before publishing. These checks
are not an exhaustive security audit or a cryptographic audit. Never force-add ignored keys,
local environment files, session databases, private deployment copies or old private Git history.
The Gitleaks configuration retains all default rules and excepts only five exact invented
idempotency UUIDs in the synthetic write acceptance fixture. Do not add broad fixture, path,
commit or UUID exemptions to hide a real credential finding.

Use the title **iCloud Reminders MCP Server for Cloudflare Workers** and a repository name such as
`icloud-reminders-mcp-for-cloudflare-workers`. The repository is MIT-licensed; preserve the
reference and vendored notices. Enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting after publication,
enable branch protection/required CI checks, and keep production secrets out of GitHub Actions.
Dependabot groups weekly minor/patch updates by ecosystem (npm and GitHub Actions). Its workflow
enables squash auto-merge for those routine bot PRs using API metadata without executing PR code.
Auto-merge waits for all four required CI checks, an up-to-date branch and resolved conversations.
Major upgrades and contributor PRs still need an explicit merge choice. Merged head branches are
deleted automatically. Keep auto-merge and branch protection enabled; do not bypass failing checks.

## Updating a private ChatGPT Site

Keep the exact Site identifier in ignored `.sites-runtime/hosting.json`. The native Sites workflow
opens its private source in `.sites-runtime/sites-source`. After it is reconciled and clean, run:

```bash
npm run sites:prepare
```

This generates the deployment source from the current public files, adds the saved Site binding,
removes stale tracked source files and excludes local secrets/session state. It refuses a different
Site, unsaved deployment-source changes or symlinked source paths. It does not register, push or
publish a Site. The Sites-capable session then builds and publishes that generated checkout using
the normal native workflow. Keep editing the main checkout, not the generated copy.

Changing the public repository's history or remote does not change the private Site's source
history, access policy, D1 database or saved Apple session. The private deployment history is
retained only under ignored `.sites-runtime/sites-source/.git` and is never public source.

## Optional source export

`npm run release:prepare` can still produce a source-only copy in
`release/icloud-reminders-mcp-for-cloudflare-workers/`, or take a new output directory argument.
It refuses to overwrite existing output and excludes Git history, environment files, session state,
build output, diagnostics and generated deployment configuration. This is optional packaging,
not a second development checkout.

Document the release as an unofficial integration, with reads and supported reminder mutations
available after authenticated Apple sign-in. Document mutation limitations and version/idempotency
protections. Unit/synthetic workerd checks do not validate
an operator's live Access policy, Managed OAuth/ChatGPT connection or Apple account authentication.
Every deployment must complete those acceptance checks with its own authorized owner. Publishing
source does not make the operator's live Site, D1 database or encrypted Apple session public.

Fresh installations use `schema.sql`, containing the session table and additive job ledger.
Existing deployments apply `migrations/0001_reminder_jobs.sql` without changing session rows,
generation, credentials or retention evidence. Sites' SQL initialization package is generated
from the same fresh-install definition; verify additive application to its existing D1.
Do not reset or recreate databases during upgrades.

Release request-driven simple bulk creation independently of linked scheduling and deletion.
Simple bulk creation is permanent once the additive schema and compatible readers are installed;
no feature flag is required. Both targets use request-driven execution exclusively.
Standalone configuration rejects Queue bindings, cron schedules and retired delivery-mode
variables. Verify authenticated continuations and preserved D1/session state when upgrading.
The verified in-place timed absolute-alarm date recipe is permanent ready-account functionality,
including active recurring occurrences; verify its shared API/MCP contracts on the target build.
Simple bulk deletion is permanent with per-item single-delete checks and post-commit subtask reports.
Other linked transitions still need separate evidence;
the loopback-only capture workflow supplies sanitized before/after diagnostics, not automatic
protocol approval. Preserve ledger, receipts and
session state during rollback. See [jobs](reminder-jobs.md) and
[protocol evidence and scope](linked-record-protocol.md).

Subtask relationships are permanent ready-account capabilities within the documented same-list,
open/undated, one-level scope. They do not enable bulk subtask creation, linked scheduling
or cascading lifecycle actions. The local connector acceptance established create,
reparent and detach behavior, not general new-child race protection. Preserve the existing
session during rollout and verify the two tool contracts on the actual deployment.
