</p>

A remote MCP server for your iCloud Reminders, with a private connection dashboard. Reads are
enabled after connecting, along with creation, editing, completion, reopening and deletion.
Deploy it through **ChatGPT Sites** or to your own **Cloudflare Worker** protected by Cloudflare
Access and Managed OAuth. No containers, Python runtime, KV namespace or Durable Objects are required.

The browser performs the Apple password proof exchange. The Worker stores Apple session cookies,
tokens, list summaries and reminder pagination state encrypted with AES-256-GCM in D1. Reminder contents
are fetched from Apple when requested and are not cached in D1.

**Experimental, unofficial integration.** This project uses Apple's undocumented web protocols,
not Sign in with Apple or an official Reminders API. The login page is served by your deployment;
you must trust its browser code with your password input. Cryptographic reference tests are not an
independent security audit. Reminder reads and mutations use unofficial Apple protocols;
review the supported fields and limitations before using them.

## Public source, private deployments

This repository publishes source under the MIT License. It does not provide a shared public
Reminders service. Each operator creates their own private deployment, database, access policy
and encryption keys. One deployment is restricted to one explicitly bound owner and one Apple
session. Do not configure it as a multi-tenant service or share the owner's MCP connection.

The development checkout is also the public source repository. The checked-in `wrangler.toml`
and `.openai/hosting.json` remain public templates. Keep the private Site binding in ignored
`.sites-runtime/hosting.json`; keep Worker-specific values in ignored deployment configuration
or the hosting platform. Never commit `.dev.vars`,
`.env`, `wrangler.production.toml`, `wrangler.generated.toml`, encryption keys, Apple cookies,
verification codes, session exports, real CloudKit records or signed asset URLs.
`npm run public-config:check` also rejects private/generated files accidentally tracked by Git.
Review Git history before publishing a repository that previously contained private metadata.

## Tools

| Tool | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `connection_status` | Report connection state, session generation and tool availability; does not contact Apple. |
| `get_reminder_lists` | Query current selectable private-zone lists directly, without historical scanning. |
| `get_reminders` | Authorize an exact `listId` live, then fetch one current page without catalogue synchronization; open reminders by default. |
| `get_all_open_reminders` | Discover selectable lists once per operation, then fetch open reminders with resumable per-list pages. |
| `get_reminder` | Read one exact ID, including completed or soft-deleted state, for current version tags and recovery. |
| `create_reminder` | Create one open reminder using a stable UUID `idempotencyKey`. |
| `update_reminder` | Edit specified fields of one open reminder using its current `recordChangeTag`. |
| `complete_reminder` | Complete one open reminder using its current version. |
| `reopen_reminder` | Reopen one completed reminder and clear its completion date. |
| `delete_reminder` | Soft-delete one open or completed reminder using its current version. |
| `prepare_reminder_update` | Preview an exact simple edit or supported timed recurring/absolute-alarm date update. |
| `create_reminder_job`, `append_reminder_job_items` | Stage encrypted, bounded immutable bulk manifests with stable UUID keys. |
| `preview_reminder_job`, `start_reminder_job` | Seal/review and accept a manifest without executing Apple mutations. |
| `get_reminder_job`, `cancel_reminder_job` | Read ordered progress or stop future dispatch; cancellation is not rollback. |
| `resume_reminder_job`, `continue_reminder_job` | Resume the same authorized scope and execute/reconcile at most three items per request. |

Tools return `structuredContent` plus a text copy for client compatibility. Every tool advertises
a typed output schema for successful results and describes its parameters in the input schema.
Application failures return `isError: true` with a
sanitized error object and matching JSON text, including recovery IDs when a write is uncertain.
Read tools are marked read-only; Apple-facing tools use `openWorldHint: true`. Creation is additive,
while editing, completion, reopening and deletion are marked destructive. All mutation tools
use `idempotentHint: true`: identical creation inputs reuse the same UUID, and existing-item writes
cannot apply twice with the same version tag. A repeated request can return `CONFLICT`; idempotency
does not promise repeated success or authorize a new request with a fresh tag.

Use the IDs returned by `get_reminder_lists`. `get_reminders` accepts `includeCompleted`, `limit`
(1–200) and its returned
`continuation`. An all-open result with `complete: false` may include a separate opaque continuation;
call `get_all_open_reminders` again with that value and combine the returned records. Inspect errors
before retrying and respect any `retryAfterSeconds`. A partial result is not the entire collection.

## Reminder write access

Creation, editing, completion, reopening and soft deletion are available to the authenticated
owner once the Apple session is ready, in both deployment modes and the local launcher. There
is no separate write approval flag. Review [the write protocol and limitations](docs/write-access.md).
`connection_status` reports `writeEnabled` and the create/update/complete/reopen/delete
capabilities based on the current connection state.

[Durable jobs](docs/reminder-jobs.md) default to authenticated continuation on both deployment targets.
Simple bulk creation is a normal ready-account capability once the additive job schema is
installed; no feature flag is required. Timed absolute-alarm date updates, including the active
occurrence of a recurring reminder, are also permanent ready-account capabilities.
Bulk deletion of simple reminders is permanent too: each item gets the single-delete exact-version and
subtask checks, and a subtask attached natively during commit is reported, not cascaded. Standalone Workers can opt into a strictly configured
Queue consumer and durable outbox recovery schedule; Sites remains request-driven. See
[the linked-date recipe and live evidence](docs/linked-record-protocol.md#permanent-in-place-absolute-date-updates)
for exact scope, preservation rules and remaining unsupported transitions.

Use `get_reminder_lists` to select a list and `get_reminders` to obtain reminder IDs and current
version tags. Creates need a new UUID `idempotencyKey` for each distinct reminder; reuse that
same key and content after an uncertain result. Updates need the last-read `recordChangeTag`
and a nonempty `changes` object. `get_reminder` reads the exact current item, including completed
or soft-deleted state, without scanning history. Only specified fields change. Supported fields are title, notes,
priority, flag, due date, time zone and all-day status, plus bounded edits to existing recurrence,
early reminders and location proximity. Scheduling updates support one absolute date alarm,
optionally one location alarm and one simple recurrence. Linked date clearing and explicit
timed/all-day conversion retire the old date-alarm pair atomically. Subtask scheduling guards
the exact open parent in the same list. See [supported recipes](docs/linked-record-protocol.md)
for required inputs and refusal boundaries. Completion, reopening and deletion refuse recurring, alarmed and nested
reminders and observed parents, and send one tagged record update. A bounded complete-list
child check fails closed on errors or unfinished pagination; it does not prove protection
against newly added, unreferenced children. No subtask cascades are supported. Use Apple's app
for parent/child lifecycle actions. Deletion sets Apple's `Deleted` marker
with a normal update; no hard-delete or restore tool is exposed. Moving lists, arbitrary linked-record
editing, recurrence creation/end/anchor changes and location creation/removal are excluded.

The `create_subtask` and `set_reminder_parent` tools create undated children, move a
simple childless reminder under a root, reparent it or return it to top level.
They are permanent ready-account capabilities; `capabilities.subtasks` reports session availability.
They require same-list, open, undated, non-recurring/un-alarmed nodes and exact child/destination
tags, with affected parents guarded in one atomic group. Deeper nesting and cascades remain
unsupported; simple bulk-create jobs still reject parent inputs. See
[subtask contracts and limits](docs/write-access.md#subtask-relationships).

`CONFLICT` requires a fresh read and review. `WRITE_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` means Apple may have saved
the change: read the indicated reminder before retrying, and never choose a new creation key
for that attempt. No mutation tool automatically retries writes or bypasses version conflicts.
Use a dedicated test reminder for your first live test. The [local acceptance procedure](docs/write-access.md#local-live-acceptance)
includes a command that creates, edits, completes, reopens and deletes only its own test item.

## Resources and configuration

| Resource | ChatGPT Sites | Standalone Cloudflare |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker and HTTPS origin | Created and managed by Sites | Create a Worker; use its Access-protected hostname or a custom domain. |
| D1 database, binding `DB` | Declared in `.openai/hosting.json`; Sites provisions it and applies the packaged current schema. | Create D1, configure its UUID and execute `schema.sql`. |
| Owner authentication | Sites' dispatch-owned ChatGPT sign-in and Site-scoped identity | Cloudflare Access application, restrictive policy and Managed OAuth; Worker verifies Access JWTs. |
| Encryption | Operator-provided Worker secret | Operator-provided Worker secret |
| MCP registration | Site-hosted plugin at `/mcp` | Register `/mcp` as a custom OAuth MCP connection. |

No R2 bucket, Workers KV, Durable Object, Apple developer application or OpenAI API key is
used by this implementation. Your Cloudflare plan must support the CPU/memory needs of the login
cryptography and your Access configuration; validate those limits in your deployment.

| Runtime setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | Exact HTTPS origin, without a path or trailing slash. |
| `REMINDERS_OWNER_ID` | Exact authenticated principal, obtained through `/api/bootstrap/identity`; never auto-claimed. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` | Active key name, for example `primary`. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEYS_JSON` **secret** | JSON key ring, for example `{"primary":"<32-byte base64 key>"}`. |
| `LIVE_APPLE_CONNECTION_APPROVED` | `controlled-device-v2` enables the operator-approved account test. |
| `APPLE_CRYPTO_REVIEW_APPROVED` | `device-proof-v2` acknowledges the operator's review of the browser proof protocol. |
| `APPLE_SESSION_RETENTION_WRITES` | `absolute-30d-v1` enables new 30-day interactive sessions **after** all readers are compatible. Empty keeps the compatibility writer on version 2. |
| `APPLE_SESSION_RETENTION_MIGRATION_JSON` **private setting** | One-time server approval with `migrationId`, `owner`, `account: "apple-reminders"` and the eligible `generation`. Disabled by default; never obtain scope from a request body. |
| `APPLE_SESSION_RENEWAL_ENABLED` | `saved-tokens-v1` enables bounded request-driven validation and saved-token exchange, independently of migration. Disabled by default. |
| `APPLE_SESSION_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | Our engineering check interval, default `21600000` (six hours); supported range five minutes–24 hours. Not an Apple validity guarantee. |
| `TEAM_DOMAIN` | Standalone only: `https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com`. |
| `POLICY_AUD` | Standalone only: Access application's audience tag. |

The two Apple login approval settings default to empty. They are operator acknowledgements, not a review
or audit performed by the software. Do not enable them before reviewing the trust boundary and
accepting the account connection. A ready authenticated Apple connection enables reads and the
supported reminder mutations.

## Local setup

Use Node.js **24 or later**, npm and the locked dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xzese/icloud-reminders-mcp-for-cloudflare-workers.git
cd icloud-reminders-mcp-for-cloudflare-workers
npm run install:ci
node scripts/setup/create-local-env.mjs
npm run build
npm run db:setup:local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. This loopback-only development preview uses a synthetic ChatGPT
identity and leaves live Apple login disabled. The environment helper creates an ignored private
`.dev.vars` with a random local encryption key and refuses to overwrite an existing file.
The database setup command executes `schema.sql` against the local preview database. Its
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement allows setup to be repeated without clearing session data.

For an explicitly approved live account investigation using the existing dashboard:

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev:icloud
```

The live launcher creates a separate encrypted local session and explicitly enables the controlled
login protocol. It listens only on IPv4 loopback, enforces a private local cookie and strips supplied
identity headers. It must remain running for local access and its automatic checks. Disconnect clears
the stored session. Its ignored `.sites-runtime/local-icloud/` is private account state, not a fixture.

Local tests and CI use synthetic data and do not require an Apple account.

The normal local launcher supports reminder changes after sign-in. Use a dedicated test reminder
for the acceptance procedure in [the write documentation](docs/write-access.md#local-live-acceptance).
The diagnostic command
`node scripts/dev/inspect-local-icloud.mjs write-shapes` performs bounded reads and reports only
field types/version presence; it does not submit a write or print reminder contents.

## ChatGPT Sites setup

You need ChatGPT Sites access and its Site-hosted MCP/plugin capability. The platform owns the
Worker, D1 binding, ChatGPT sign-in, MCP connection and publication. Do not deploy its generated
configuration with Wrangler as a substitute for Sites publication.

1. Make this source available to a Sites-capable coding session. Ask it to create a **new private
   Site** from this repository with D1 binding `DB` and MCP capability. The public manifest starts
   without a `project_id`; the platform must register your Site. Save its exact returned identifier
   in ignored `.sites-runtime/hosting.json` as `{"project_id":"<your-project-id>"}`.
   Reuse that identifier for later updates. Never copy another operator's project ID.
2. Keep `.openai/hosting.json` configured with `"d1": "DB"` and `"capabilities": ["mcp"]`.
   Have the Sites-capable session open the Site's private source checkout in
   `.sites-runtime/sites-source` through the native Sites workflow. Run `npm run sites:prepare`
   from the main checkout to copy the current public source and add the private binding there.
   Build and publish **from that generated checkout** through the Sites source/version workflow,
   including the complete build output. The helper can reuse the main checkout's installed
   dependencies; otherwise install them in the generated checkout. Edit application code in
   the main checkout, and reconcile any unsaved Site-source changes before preparing another copy.
   The build packages `schema.sql` in Sites'
   expected SQL initialization layout; Sites provisions the logical D1 binding and applies it.
   Fresh-install `schema.sql` and the additive SQL migration need no Drizzle installation or migration generation.
3. Obtain the published HTTPS origin. In the Site's runtime settings, set `APP_ORIGIN` to that exact
   origin and `ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` to `primary`. Generate the key ring locally:

   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy/create-encryption-key.mjs primary
   ```

   This output is a secret. Enter it directly as the Site secret `ENCRYPTION_KEYS_JSON`; do not
   paste it into chat or commit it. Keep both Apple approval settings empty at this stage.
4. Open the private Site and **Sign in with ChatGPT**. Use **Copy Site identity**, or open
   `/api/bootstrap/identity`, and bind the returned `authenticatedUserId` as `REMINDERS_OWNER_ID`
   in the Site runtime settings. This identifier is scoped to that Site. Refresh the dashboard.
5. Review the login protocol and security policy. If you approve the controlled test, set the two
   Apple approval settings to the exact values in the configuration table. Environment changes
   must be activated by the platform's environment/deployment workflow. Complete Apple setup as
   described below; verify the hosted connection and a small read before wider use.
6. Open the Site's plugin connection settings. Install and connect its generated plugin in ChatGPT,
   then choose it in a new chat. The endpoint is `https://<your-site>/mcp`. Sites manages the MCP
   OAuth connection; its non-user service token is not a substitute for the owner's identity.

List and all-open MCP calls discover current lists directly. No historical scanning or scheduled
refresh is required. Dashboard polling reads the encrypted saved snapshot without contacting Apple.

## Cloudflare Worker setup

### 1. Create the Worker and database

Use your own Cloudflare account and Zero Trust organization. Copy the public configuration:

```bash
npx wrangler login
cp wrangler.toml wrangler.production.toml
npx wrangler d1 create icloud-reminders
```

In `wrangler.production.toml`, set your Worker `name` and the returned D1 `database_id`; retain
binding `DB`. Set `APP_ORIGIN` to your intended Worker HTTPS origin.
Keep Apple login disabled and owner identity empty. The generated Worker name determines the
`*.workers.dev` hostname; a custom-domain deployment must use that exact domain as `APP_ORIGIN`.

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute icloud-reminders --remote --config wrangler.production.toml --file schema.sql
npm run deploy:cloudflare
```

The first deployment intentionally rejects requests until Access is configured. The build uses
`src/index.ts`, not the Sites-only entrypoint, and routes static assets through the verified Worker
before serving them. `wrangler.production.toml` and the generated config are ignored by Git.

### 2. Configure Cloudflare Access and Managed OAuth

1. Create an Access application covering the **entire Worker hostname**, including the dashboard,
   `/api/`, `/connect/apple`, authentication WebSockets and `/mcp`. Use a self-hosted application
   with Managed OAuth, or the current MCP application flow in your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Restrict its Allow policy to the single intended owner. Configure your identity provider and
   MFA. Do not use a public Allow-all or Bypass policy.
3. Enable **Managed OAuth** for the application and allow only redirect URIs needed by your MCP
   clients. This makes Access's OAuth flow available to ChatGPT while the browser uses Access
   sign-in. Do not replace the assertion with a shared bearer token.
4. Copy the team domain and application AUD into `TEAM_DOMAIN` and `POLICY_AUD` in your ignored
   production config. Cover every reachable hostname with Access. Disable unused `workers.dev`
   routes if using a custom domain; preview URLs are disabled by the generated configuration.
5. Redeploy with `npm run deploy:cloudflare`.

The Worker independently verifies the signed `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`, issuer, audience, validity
and owner identity before API, dashboard or WebSocket routing. Client-supplied ChatGPT identity
headers are removed. Managed OAuth tokens are opaque; Access resolves them at the edge and
forwards a signed user assertion. The Worker does not treat an arbitrary OAuth bearer as a JWT.

See Cloudflare's [Managed OAuth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/managed-oauth/)
and [JWT validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/authorization-cookie/validating-json/)
guides for current application setup and token behaviour.

### 3. Bind your owner and install encryption

Sign in through Access, then open `https://<worker-host>/api/bootstrap/identity`. Copy the verified
`authenticatedUserId` into `REMINDERS_OWNER_ID`. The server never claims the first visitor as owner.
Other routes remain unavailable until this binding is configured.

For a **brand-new** deployment, install the key ring without writing it to a file:

```bash
node scripts/deploy/create-encryption-key.mjs primary | npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEYS_JSON --config wrangler.production.toml
```

Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` to `primary`. Do not replace the key ring on an existing deployment: existing
sessions need their original key. Keep previous keys available during intentional rotation, or
explicitly disconnect sessions before removing their keys.

After reviewing the browser proof protocol and approving a controlled account test, set
`LIVE_APPLE_CONNECTION_APPROVED` and `APPLE_CRYPTO_REVIEW_APPROVED` to the values in the table,
then deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy:cloudflare
```

Open `https://<worker-host>/` and complete the Apple setup below. Verify Access denial for an
unauthenticated request, correct owner binding, device verification and a controlled reminder read
on your actual deployment. Synthetic tests do not prove the deployed Access policy or Apple flow.

## Connect ChatGPT

For a standalone Worker, add this endpoint as a custom OAuth MCP connection:

```text
https://<worker-host>/mcp
```

Enable developer/custom MCP connections where available in your ChatGPT account, create the
connection using the endpoint and **OAuth**, and complete Cloudflare Access sign-in. ChatGPT UI
labels and account availability can change; use the current custom plugin/app connection flow.
Choose the connection in a new chat and ask it to call `connection_status`, then
`get_all_open_reminders`. For ChatGPT Sites, use the generated Site plugin instead.

Never send your Apple password, device code, encryption keys or cookies to the chat or an MCP tool.

## Connect your Apple account

1. Open your own private deployment and select its iCloud connection action. The dedicated
   credential page opens at `/connect/apple`; it is your project's page, not an Apple OAuth page.
2. Enter your Apple Account and password there. The browser derives authentication proofs; the
   application API does not accept the raw password or password-derived keys.
3. Read and accept the remembered-browser and encrypted-session consent statements. Apple's
   remembered trust may last longer than this application's local session limit.
4. Approve the trusted-device prompt and enter the six-digit code **on the credential page** when
   its code field appears. SMS, voice and legacy device-code fallbacks are not supported.
5. Return to the dashboard. If Apple separately requires web access to your Reminders keys,
   approve that request on your device. The dashboard checks approval automatically while visible,
   respecting Apple’s retry time. **Check Apple approval** remains available if automatic checks
   pause after repeated errors or their safety limit. Device verification and Reminders-data
   approval are separate steps.
6. Confirm the session is ready, then use a reminder MCP tool. Known-list reads verify access and
   fetch reminders directly. List discovery uses the direct query described below.

The approved local application session lasts at most **30 days from the original device verification**:
`expiresAt = verifiedAt + 2_592_000_000`. Reads, writes and saved-token renewal never extend it. Apple can
reject it sooner; reconnect when required. Disconnect deletes the encrypted session record,
list snapshots and reminder continuations. Expired records are cleared on next access, not by a timed purge.

Both strict login-assurance versions remain readable. Legacy version 2 keeps its exact 24-hour
deadline until the configured owner authorises a generation-scoped migration. Migration changes
only encrypted retention evidence and the row version; it makes no Apple requests and preserves
the original verification, credentials and list state. Roll out compatible readers first, migrate,
remove the one-time approval, then enable renewal and future 30-day sign-ins. See
[session retention, deployment and compatible rollback](docs/session-retention.md).
Status exposes the local deadline and separate validation/operation/renewal timestamps, never tokens.
“Connected” reports restored saved state, not a fresh Apple check or a promise of 30 days of Apple access.

## Use the dashboard

Sign in to your private workspace, then select **Connect Apple account**. **Your lists** shows the
saved list count and last successful retrieval time. **Refresh lists**
fetches current lists; a failed refresh keeps the previous snapshot visible and reports an error.
The 15-second display polling reads saved status only and does not contact Apple.

- **Preview reminders** verifies the selected list live and fetches open reminders. **Include
  completed reminders** and **Show more reminders** retain their existing behavior.
- **Testing & details** contains exact list lookup, response details and bounded reminder diagnostics.
- **Disconnect Apple account** deletes the encrypted session, snapshots and continuations.
  Workspace sign-out does not disconnect Apple.

## Direct retrieval and pagination

Direct CloudKit querying is the sole list-discovery path. Historical scanning, checkpoints,
automatic catalogue work and strategy selection have been removed. If Apple rejects the query,
the call reports the classified error; it does not switch to a historical fallback. Known-list
reminder reads can still authorize a list and fetch its contents independently of discovery.

Direct discovery validates the authenticated private Reminders zone, sends `query.recordType=Lists`
and accepts singular `List` records. It follows opaque `continuationMarker` pages without any
`/changes/zone` calls. List membership, reminder titles, notes and attachments are not requested;
no field projection is sent because support for `desiredKeys` on this special query is unverified.
Extra returned fields are discarded from summaries. Empty lists are retained; MCP list results and
all-open selection exclude deleted lists and groups. Shared-database lists are not discovered.

**Live validation is limited to one account.** An approved local test on 2026-10-09 returned the
owner's three expected lists, picked up a new list and removed it after deletion, with zero change
calls. Live pagination, groups, renamed/old/empty-list coverage and shared-list completeness remain
unverified. Direct discovery is now the only path at the owner’s request; these remaining limits
are not evidence of broader completeness. The [pinned external reference](https://github.com/fineyh/icloud-reminders-desktop/blob/3dbbbed9eef3d2f3a6d13be28475c2d4585504a0/src/backend/reminders_api.py)
supports the request format, while synthetic tests cover parsing and bounded continuation handling. See
[discovery evidence and validation procedure](docs/direct-list-retrieval.md).

Each direct refresh is bounded to 25 query pages, 20 seconds, 1,000 identifiers and a 1 MiB summary
budget with response overhead reserved. Individual transport timeouts still apply. A complete
refresh atomically replaces the encrypted snapshot, including removals. Duplicate identical
summaries are deduplicated; conflicting summaries, malformed records or wrong owners fail safely.
Repeated continuations and incomplete/error pages never publish a complete catalogue. A bounded
incomplete discovery returns `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE` and preserves the last snapshot. List discovery
does not expose a resumable MCP cursor; collections exceeding these bounds cannot currently
complete list discovery. Retry a transient failure; persistent limits or unsupported queries require
a future protocol change. There is no historical fallback.

Direct list responses report `source: "direct-cloudkit-query"` and `freshness.mode: "live"`.
There is no TTL cache: normal direct list calls and explicit refreshes contact Apple. Saved dashboard
summaries are display-only and are never proof of authorization for a reminder read.
`get_reminders` validates its exact list ID with a current owner-bound lookup, rejects inaccessible,
deleted or group records, then runs the existing live `reminderList` query. A missing, pending or
expired historical checkpoint does not block this path, in either discovery mode.

`get_reminders` returns one bounded page; pass its continuation with the same list ID and completed
option. `get_all_open_reminders` discovers lists once when starting and saves its selection in the
encrypted session. Resumptions use that original selection even after a separate refresh. It keeps
independent 20-page/20-second, 5,000-record and response-size bounds, with a single-use, ten-minute
owner/session-bound continuation. Combine successful pages, inspect failures before retrying and
respect `retryAfterSeconds`. `complete: true` requires every selected list to finish successfully.
Results across lists are not an atomic Apple snapshot. Reminder contents are never persisted.

Existing encrypted version-1 sessions remain compatible; no D1 migration or session reset is
required. Recognized historical checkpoint, scheduler and recovery fields are ignored on load and
removed on the next successful encrypted commit. Their old all-open continuations are retired;
start a new all-open operation if one conflicts after upgrade. Valid direct-query continuations,
credentials, list snapshots, owner boundaries and absolute expiry remain intact. Unknown active
fields still fail strict validation.

Remove old `REMINDERS_LIST_DISCOVERY`, `CATALOGUE_BACKGROUND_RUNNER` and
`REMINDERS_ENABLE_CRON` settings from operator configuration. They no longer select a strategy or
start work. Remove previously provisioned catalogue Cron triggers when deploying the upgrade;
the Worker no longer exports a scheduled handler. Generated deployment configs omit triggers.
No production configuration is changed by this source update.

## Cloudflare repository builds

Keep actual resource identifiers and runtime settings in Cloudflare, not in public Git source:

1. Configure `REMINDERS_D1_DATABASE_ID` as a protected **build** environment variable. Set
   `REMINDERS_WORKER_NAME` if your Worker name differs from `icloud-reminders-mcp-server`.
2. Configure runtime plaintext settings from the table in the Worker dashboard, and install
   `ENCRYPTION_KEYS_JSON` as a runtime secret. Build variables are not runtime variables.
3. Use `npm run install:ci` to install, and `npm run deploy:cloudflare` as the deployment command.
   Initialize a new D1 database by executing `schema.sql` before its first deployment. The generated config uses
   `keep_vars = true` and omits `[vars]` in this path so dashboard configuration is retained.

No GitHub workflow in this repository deploys production or receives Apple credentials.

## Development and project structure

Dependabot checks weekly and groups routine minor/patch updates into one npm PR and one GitHub
Actions PR. Routine bot updates enable squash auto-merge automatically; the four protected-branch
CI checks must pass before merging. Major upgrades remain manual, and failed updates stay blocked.
Minor/patch npm security fixes are grouped separately and handled when alerts arrive.
Merged branches are deleted automatically. The automation follows the
[email MCP server's workflow](https://github.com/Xzese/email-mcp-for-cloudflare-workers/blob/main/.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml).
Builds also refresh the dependency inventory and third-party notices automatically, so a
dependency update ships current attribution without a separate generated-file PR. The local
and acceptance runners declare their Miniflare API version explicitly; a Wrangler update
does not silently migrate those runners to a new major API.

Copy `wrangler.toml` to ignored `wrangler.production.toml` for your own deployment settings.
Deployment preparation produces ignored `wrangler.generated.toml`. The minimal
`wrangler.build.toml` isolates framework builds from production settings. Vite generates
`dist/server/wrangler.json` internally; that generated file is not an editable source configuration.

The source contains `apple_session_state` and the additive encrypted job ledger. The Worker uses
native D1 prepared statements. The Sites build derives its platform SQL package from `schema.sql`.
Fresh databases use that definition; existing databases apply `migrations/0001_reminder_jobs.sql`
using the [documented upgrade path](docs/reminder-jobs.md), without resetting session data.

Run the checks before contributing:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:worker
npm run test:local
npm run verify:artifact
npm run public-config:check
npm run build:check
```

The standalone bundle check is a dry run: it does not upload or deploy. It leaves a standalone
build in `dist/`; run `npm run build` again before running the Sites/local live launcher.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for pull-request expectations.

## Security and licensing

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible reporting, trust boundaries and deployment duties.
The owner of the Worker and its encryption key can decrypt stored session credentials. Encryption
at rest does not protect against a compromised server, browser login script or operator account.
Use restrictive access, protect the encryption key, and keep dependencies current.

Original project contributions use the [MIT License](LICENSE). Preserve upstream notices in
[provenance/NOTICE.md](provenance/NOTICE.md) and `provenance/licenses/`. The Sites build adapter and
vendored UI assets have their own preserved notices. MIT licensing does not establish rights in
Apple protocols, trademarks or account data. Apple, iCloud and Reminders are trademarks of Apple Inc.;
